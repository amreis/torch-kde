# TorchKDE

A differentiable implementation of kernel density estimation in PyTorch. 

## What is included?



## Supported Settings

The current implementation only provides basic functionality.

**Supported kernels**: Gaussian.

**Supported tree algorithms**: Standard (which corresponds to a simple root tree that returns the entire data set).

**Supported bandwidths**: Only floats, bandwiths estimators such as scott or silverman and are not supported.
